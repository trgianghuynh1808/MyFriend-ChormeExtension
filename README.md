# ShortcutLinks-ReactHook-ChormeExtension


**Description:**

This is an extension. Here users can create shortcuts to links. It has the same function as with chrome's "bookmarks". Instead of creating a "bookmark" you can create the fastest shortcut. The current function is only a primitive version, my goal is to create a shortcut by voice recognition. It will be much more convenient than the current version.

**TechStack:** ReactHook, Javascript.
